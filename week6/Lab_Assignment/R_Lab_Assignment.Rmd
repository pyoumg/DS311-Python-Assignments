## R Assignment 1

* In this assignment, we are going to apply some of the build in data set in R for descriptive statistics analysis.
* To earn full grade in this assignment, students need to complete the coding tasks for each question to get the result.
* After finished all the questions, knit the document into HTML format for submission.

### Question 1

Using the **mtcars** data set in R, please answer the following questions.

```{r}
# Loading the data
data(mtcars)

# Head of the data set
head(mtcars)
```

a. Report the number of variables and observations in the data set.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!


# Answer:
print("There are total of _____ variables and _____ observations in this data set.")
```



b. Print the summary statistics of the data set and report how many discrete and continuous variables are in the data set.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!


# Answer:
print("There are _____ discrete variables and _____ continuous variables in this data set.")
```



c. Calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation for the variable **mpg** and assign them into variable names m, v, and s. Report the results in the print statement.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!




# print(paste("The average of Mile Per Gallon from this data set is ",  , " with variance ",  , " and standard deviation",  , "."))
```



d. Create two tables to summarize 1) average mpg for each cylinder class and 2) the standard deviation of mpg for each gear class.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!




```



e. Create a crosstab that shows the number of observations belong to each cylinder and gear class combinations. The table should show how many observations given the car has 4 cylinders with 3 gears, 4 cylinders with 4 gears, etc. Report which combination is recorded in this data set and how many observations for this type of car.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!


print("The most common car type in this data set is car with ____ cylinders and ____ gears. There are total of _____ cars belong to this specification in the data set.")
```

### Question 2

Use different visualization tools to summarize the data sets in this question.

a. Using the **PlantGrowth** data set, visualize and compare the weight of the plant in the three separated group. Give labels to the title, x-axis, and y-axis on the graph. Write a paragraph to summarize your findings.

```{r}
# Load the data set
data("PlantGrowth")

# Head of the data set
head(PlantGrowth)

# Enter your code here!


```

Result:

=> Report a paragraph to summarize your findings from the plot!



b. Using the **mtcars** data set, plot the histogram for the column **mpg** with 10 breaks. Give labels to the title, x-axis, and y-axis on the graph. Report the most observed mpg class from the data set.

```{r}



print("Most of the cars in this data set are in the class of ______ mile per gallon.")
```



c. Using the **USArrests** data set, create a pairs plot to display the correlations between the variables in the data set. Plot the scatter plot with **Murder** and **Assault**. Give labels to the title, x-axis, and y-axis on the graph. Write a paragraph to summarize your results from both plots.

```{r}
# Load the data set
data("USArrests")

# Head of the data set
head(USArrests)

# Enter your code here!


```

Result:

=> Report a paragraph to summarize your findings from the plot!

### Question 3

Download the housing data set from www.jaredlander.com and find out what explains the housing prices in New York City.

Note: Check your working directory to make sure that you can download the data into the data folder. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load and clean the housing data set 
download.file(url='https://www.jaredlander.com/data/housing.csv',
              destfile='data/housing.csv', mode='wb')
housingData <- read.csv('data/housing.csv')
housingData <- subset(housingData, 
                      select = c("Neighborhood", "Market.Value.per.SqFt", "Boro", "Year.Built"))
housingData <- na.omit(housingData)                   
```

a. Create your own descriptive statistics and aggregation tables to summarize the data set and find any meaningful results between different variables in the data set.

```{r}
# Head of the cleaned data set
head(housingData)

# Enter your code here!


```

b. Create multiple plots to demonstrates the correlations between different variables. Remember to label all axes and give title to each graph.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!


```

c. Write a summary about your findings from this exercise.
